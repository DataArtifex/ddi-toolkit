          Items are the basic unit for a Postman collection.
          You can think of them as corresponding to a single API endpoint.
          Each Item has one request and may have multiple API responses associated with it.

        title: Name of the collection
        description: >-
          A collection's friendly name is defined by this field. 
          You would want to set this field to a value that would allow you to easily identify this collection among a bunch of other collections, as such outlining its usage or content.
        range: string
        required: true
      _postman_id:
        description: >-
          Every collection is identified by the unique value of this field. 
          The value of this field is usually easiest to generate using a UID generator function. 
          If you already have a collection, it is recommended that you maintain the same id since changing the id usually implies that is a different collection than it was originally.
          *Note: This field exists for compatibility reasons with Collection Format V1.*

        title: Collection Version
        description: >-
          Postman allows you to version your collections as they grow, and this field holds the version number.
