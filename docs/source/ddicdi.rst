DDI Cross Domain Integration
============================

DDI Cross Domain Integration (CDI) is in early stage and current development work is exploratory.
Very little is documented at this time.

The current objective is to create base classes and methods to create and manipulate DDI-CDI resources.
The focus is on supporting the profile being advocated by the CODATA [Cross Domain Interoperability Framework](https://cdif.codata.org/).
