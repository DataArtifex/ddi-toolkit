Data Artifex DDI Toolkit
========================

This package provides classes and helpers for using, generating, processing, or converting metadata based on the `Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) <https://ddialliance.org/>`, an international standard for describing the data produced by surveys and other observational methods in the social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences.

There are three major flavors of DDI: DDI-Codebbok, DDI-Lifecycle, and the upcoming DDI Cross Domain Integration (CDI). 

This package focuses on `DDI-Codebook <https://ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Codebook/2.5/>`, the light-weight version of the standard, intended primarily to document simple survey data. 
This specification has been widely adopted around the globe by statistical agencies, data producers, archives, research centers, and international organizations. 
Thousands of datasets have been documented with DDI-C.

We are also exploring and providing experimental support for `DDI-CDI <https://ddialliance.org/Specification/ddi-cdi>`, 

We do not at this time support `DDI-Lifecycle <https://ddialliance.org/Specification/ddi-cdi>`.
